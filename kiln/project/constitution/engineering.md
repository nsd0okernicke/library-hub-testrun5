# Engineering Rules

- On startup, acquire the github tools for the project language and get them ready to run.
- Language tool table:
  - Python: install with `pip` / `uv`; mutation `cosmic-ray` (`pip install cosmic-ray`), CRAP/complexity `radon` (`pip install radon`), linting `ruff` (`pip install ruff`), formatting `black` (`pip install black`), type checking `mypy` (`pip install mypy`).
    - Deliberately not `mutmut`: it refuses to start on native Windows and prints "please use
      the WSL" (boxed/mutmut#397). The "one execution environment per worktree" rule below
      forbids the only workaround it offers, so on Windows the two rules together make the
      mutation gate unsatisfiable. `cosmic-ray` runs natively everywhere Kiln does.
  - Quality gates (Python):
    - **Dependency scanning** — `pip-audit` (`pip install pip-audit`) or `safety` for known-vulnerability scans.
    - **Documentation coverage** — `interrogate` (`pip install interrogate`) to check public-interface docstrings.
    - **Import enforcement** — `import-linter` (`pip install import-linter`) to enforce dependency direction rules (domain must not import infrastructure).
    - **SAST / security scanning** — `bandit[sarif]` (`pip install bandit[sarif]`) for static analysis of changed files with SARIF output.
    - **Complexity analysis** — `radon` (`pip install radon`) for cyclomatic complexity and maintainability index.
  - Declare every quality-gate tool in `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` in `pyproject.toml` so a fresh install (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`) brings in the full gate toolchain. Tools left out of the declared dependencies vanish silently on environment rebuild.
- Work in small, reviewable increments.
- Prefer the simplest design that supports the current behavior and leaves clear options for the next step.
- Keep tests close to the behavior being changed.
- Separate testable modules from environmentally unsuitable modules that open GUIs, depend on external devices, throw environment errors, emit system errors, or hang under automated tests. Maximize testable code and minimize the unsuitable boundary.
- Only testable modules should participate in tools that run tests, including unit tests, acceptance tests, coverage, mutation testing, CRAP analysis, DRY analysis that invokes tests, and property tests.
- Keep property tests separate from normal verification. Do not include property-test tags in normal unit coverage, language mutation tools, CRAP, or coverage commands unless the role owns property-test verification or the user explicitly asks for property tests.
- Before running language, build, or test commands, prefer project-local cache/configuration paths inside the assigned worktree. Avoid default cache locations that write outside the project and may trigger sandbox or permission restrictions.
- Run the relevant local verification command before handoff whenever the project has one.
- Do not commit unrelated local changes or generated artifacts unless required for the task.
- Before relying on an unfamiliar command, inspect local help or project documentation.
- Pick one execution environment per worktree and stay in it. Do not fall back from the native
  toolchain to a container, a VM or WSL (or the reverse) partway through a task: files created by
  one side are frequently not writable by the other, and the failure surfaces as a permission
  error deep inside a tool rather than as a configuration problem. If the native path does not
  work, say so in the handoff instead of switching.
- Prefer an invocation that needs no shell state. Name an interpreter or binary by path rather
  than relying on a prior command having changed the environment — `\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
  -m pytest`, not `activate` followed by `pytest`. A state-changing step is one more thing that
  can hang or silently not apply, and when it does the failure appears in an unrelated command
  much later.
- A command that has not finished is not a command that needs more waiting. If you are polling
  something you started and it has not progressed after a few checks, stop, kill it, and report
  what it was — do not keep polling. Observed live: a worker recognised its own hung step
  ("a shell activation issue, not a test failure") and then polled it another 30 times until
  the cycle died with nothing handed off.
- A test suite that depends on an external runtime — a container engine, a database server, a
  message broker — must probe for it before running, and if it is absent, skip that suite and
  state the gap in the handoff. Do not let the suite discover this for itself: a container
  fixture waits on the daemon indefinitely rather than failing, so the run does not error, it
  simply stops, and the worker is killed by its timeout with nothing to show. `docker info`
  is the probe for a container engine.
- Delete a tool's generated output before re-running it — mutation working copies, coverage data,
  build directories. These survive a *successful* run too, so the cycle that inherits them is
  usually not the one that produced them.
- A behaviour that returns an ordered list must name its sort key in the specification prose, not
  only in example data. "In a stable order" is not a specification: two roles will read it
  differently, both defensibly, and the disagreement surfaces as a failing acceptance test that
  neither of them can resolve alone.
