# LibraryHub — Library Loan System

## Installation

LibraryHub is a reference example for Kiln. To create a new LibraryHub project:

### Prerequisites

- **Windows**: PowerShell 7+, Git
- **Unix/macOS**: Bash/zsh, Git
- Claude Code CLI (to run agents in the swarm)
- **A running container engine** (Docker Desktop, Podman, Colima). The acceptance suite uses
  Testcontainers to start real PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ — see "Acceptance Fixtures" below.
  Verify with `docker info` before starting a swarm: with no daemon reachable, the fixtures
  block indefinitely rather than failing, and the cycle dies on its timeout with no diagnosis.

### Setup

Run the install script **from the Kiln repository root**:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\bin\kiln.ps1 -Init -WorkingDir C:\path\to\my-library-hub -Example library-hub
cd C:\path\to\my-library-hub
```

**Unix/macOS (Bash):**
```bash
./bin/kiln.sh init /path/to/my-library-hub --example library-hub
cd /path/to/my-library-hub
```

### What the Script Creates

The install script scaffolds a complete, ready-to-run Kiln project with:
- **Constitution files** — `kiln/project/constitution/` with framework rules (engineering.md, workflow.md) and project-specific configuration
- **Agent role prompts** — `kiln/project/roles/` with specifier, coder, refactorer, architect instructions
- **Project configuration** — `kiln.profiles.json` at the project root defining the swarm topology (optional; replaces the framework profile set it would otherwise inherit)
- **Git repository** — Initialized on `main` branch with all files committed
- **Claude Code permissions** — `.claude/settings.json` pre-configured for agents
- **This brief** — `README.md` with architecture and user stories for agents to implement

### Launch the Swarm

Navigate back to the **Kiln repository root** and launch with the project as the working directory:

**Windows:**
```powershell
cd C:\path\to\kiln
.\bin\kiln.ps1 -WorkingDir C:\path\to\my-library-hub
```

**Unix/macOS:**
```bash
cd /path/to/kiln
./bin/kiln.sh /path/to/my-library-hub
```

Kiln will:
1. Create git worktrees for each agent (coder, refactorer, architect; specifier works on main)
2. Initialize tmux sessions or terminal windows/tabs
3. Generate and inject `CLAUDE.md` with full constitution + role + project context into each agent's environment
4. Launch the multi-agent collaboration

## Overview

LibraryHub is a simple but realistic digital library system where users can search for books, borrow them, and return them over a deadline. The system uses two independent microservices communicating via asynchronous messaging to maintain eventual consistency and decouple concerns.

This project serves as the **reference example for SwarmForge** — demonstrating a realistic use case with full TDD discipline, clean architecture, and multi-agent collaboration across specifier, coder, refactorer, and architect roles.

## Bounded Contexts

### Catalog Service
Owns the book catalog and stock management. Manages all book metadata (title, author, genre, description) and the current available count per ISBN. Publishes events when books are reserved or out of stock. Consumes book-return events to replenish stock and keep availability current. Database: PostgreSQL (books, book_stock tables).

### Loan Service
Owns user accounts and loan records with deadlines and overdue tracking. When a user requests to borrow, immediately returns PENDING and publishes a request event; consumes reservation results (ACTIVE/REJECTED) asynchronously. Manages loan lifecycle: PENDING → ACTIVE/REJECTED → RETURNED. Tracks due dates (default 28 days, configurable) and overdue items. Database: PostgreSQL (users, loans tables).

## User Stories

### Catalog Service
- **CAT-3**: Create new book with metadata and initial stock
- **CAT-5**: Retrieve single book by ISBN
- **CAT-1**: Search books by title, author, or genre with pagination
- **CAT-2**: Check book availability by ISBN
- **CAT-4**: Automatically increase stock when BookReturned event arrives
- **CAT-6**: Manual stock return endpoint

### Loan Service
- **LOAN-0**: Create user account to borrow books
- **LOAN-1**: Borrow book (immediate 202 Accepted response)
- **LOAN-2**: View single loan status
- **LOAN-3**: View all loans for a user
- **LOAN-4**: Return book
- **LOAN-5**: View overdue loans (admin)

## User Story Clarifications

Ambiguities resolved during a human-in-the-loop clarification pass over the user stories above.
For the specifier to turn into Gherkin — not prescriptive of implementation.

### CAT-3: Create new book
- Required fields: `isbn` (unique, validated format), `title`, `author`, `genre`,
  `initial_stock` (integer >= 0). `description` is optional.
- Creating a book with an ISBN that already exists returns 409 Conflict.

### CAT-2 vs. CAT-5 (availability vs. retrieve by ISBN)
- CAT-5 (`GET /books/{isbn}`) returns full book metadata plus the current available stock
  count.
- CAT-2 remains a separate, lightweight endpoint returning just `{isbn, available_count}`, for
  cheap availability checks (e.g. from the Loan Service).

### CAT-1: Search books
- `title`, `author`, `genre` are independent optional query parameters, each doing
  case-insensitive substring matching; when more than one is supplied they combine with AND.
- Pagination: `page` (1-indexed, default 1) and `page_size` (default 20, max 100). Response
  includes the total result count.
- Default sort order: `title` ascending.
- The catalog is pre-seeded with three books. In title-ascending order they are:
  1. Dune (ISBN 978-0-20-163361-0)
  2. Refactoring (ISBN 978-0-13-468599-1)
  3. The Hobbit (ISBN 978-3-16-148410-0)
  Paginated queries reference these positions. For example, page 2 with page_size 1 returns
  the second entry: Refactoring.

### CAT-6: Manual stock return endpoint
- An admin/ops stock-correction tool: lets an operator add N copies to an ISBN's stock
  directly (drift correction, new acquisitions, recovering from a missed `BookReturned`
  event).
- Independent of any specific loan record — not a duplicate of the user-facing return flow.

### LOAN-0: Create user account
- Required fields: `name`, `email` (unique). The system generates a `user_id`, which
  identifies the user on all subsequent loan calls. No password or authentication.

### LOAN-1: Borrow book
- If the catalog reservation result is REJECTED, the loan record persists in REJECTED status
  and stays queryable via LOAN-2/LOAN-3 rather than being deleted.
- No limit on concurrent active loans per user, and no restriction on requesting an ISBN the
  user already holds an active loan for.
- The loan due date term (default 28 days) is a single global configuration value; it is not
  overridable per borrow request.

### LOAN-3: View all loans for a user
- Paginated with the same `page`/`page_size` scheme as CAT-1 (default 20, max 100), sorted by
  `created_at` descending (newest first).

### LOAN-4: Return book
- Only an ACTIVE loan can be returned. Attempting to return a PENDING, REJECTED, or
  already-RETURNED loan returns 409 Conflict.
- Returning does not check overdue status for any penalty (no payment system in MVP) — it
  transitions the loan to RETURNED and publishes `BookReturned` regardless of due date.

### LOAN-5: View overdue loans (admin)
- "Admin" means a separate, unauthenticated endpoint — no access control in MVP, consistent
  with "Authentication: Not required for MVP" under Non-Functional Requirements.
- Overdue = loan is ACTIVE and `due_date < now`.

    end

```

The two services communicate via asynchronous messaging (event-driven), enabling eventual consistency and full decoupling.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- User authentication and JWT
- Email/SMS notifications
- Payment system
- Complex user management or role-based access
- Frontend / UI
- Book cover images or advanced metadata

## Architecture & Layering Rules

### 3-Layer Structure

The codebase is organized into three layers with unidirectional dependencies (always flowing from outside to inside):

1. **Infrastructure** (outermost, knows everything)
   - FastAPI REST API, SQLAlchemy ORM, RabbitMQ adapters, Pydantic schemas
   - Responsibility: HTTP bindings, database adapters, message queue handlers, dependency injection
   - Location: `infrastructure/` package

2. **Application** (middle, orchestrates domain via ports)
   - Use cases, application services
   - Knows `domain/`, uses `domain/ports/`, does NOT import from `infrastructure/`
   - Location: `application/` package

3. **Domain** (innermost, pure business logic)
   - Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events, Port Interfaces (ABCs)
   - Zero dependencies on `application/` or `infrastructure/`
   - Location: `domain/` package

### Dependency Rules (Enforced)

| From | To | Allowed? |
| ---- | -- | -------- |
| `infrastructure/` | `application/` | Yes |
| `infrastructure/` | `domain/` | Yes |
| `application/` | `domain/` | Yes |
| `application/` | `infrastructure/` | No (only via ports) |
| `domain/` | `application/` | No |
| `domain/` | `infrastructure/` | No |

Violations detected by static analysis tools (mypy) or code review must be fixed before merge.

### Mapping Pattern

- **HTTP Request** (Pydantic DTO) → mapped by `infrastructure/api/` → **Domain Object** → **Use Case**
- **Domain Object** → mapped by `infrastructure/db/` → **ORM Model** → **Database**
- **Database** → **ORM Model** → mapped by `infrastructure/db/` → **Domain Object** → returned via API

Domain classes are **pure Python dataclasses** with no ORM (SQLAlchemy) or schema (Pydantic) imports.

### Package Structure (Per Service)

Flat layout — no `src/` wrapper. Each service is a Python package at the project root:

```text
<service>/                           (Python package, e.g. catalog/ or loans/)
├── __init__.py
├── domain/
│   ├── <entity>.py                  (pure dataclasses, business logic)
│   ├── events.py                    (domain events as dataclasses)
│   └── ports.py                     (ABC interfaces, no implementation)
├── application/
│   └── <use_case>.py                (orchestrates domain, calls ports)
└── infrastructure/
    ├── api/
    │   ├── main.py                  (FastAPI app)
    │   ├── schemas.py               (Pydantic DTOs)
    │   └── routers/                 (FastAPI endpoints)
    ├── db/
    │   ├── models.py                (SQLAlchemy ORM models)
    │   └── <x>_repository.py        (port implementations)
    ├── messaging/
    │   ├── publisher.py             (RabbitMQ publisher adapter)
    │   └── consumer.py              (RabbitMQ consumer adapter)
    └── config/
        └── settings.py              (pydantic-settings)
```

Gherkin feature files live at the project root in `features/` (not inside a service directory).

## Running Services Locally

To start each service for manual testing or development:

```bash
# Catalog service (default port 8000)
uvicorn catalog.infrastructure.api.main:app --reload

# Loans service (alternate port to avoid conflict)
uvicorn loans.infrastructure.api.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Both services expect environment setup (database connections, RabbitMQ, etc.) — see
Infrastructure section for bootstrap requirements.

## Tech Stack (Locked Decisions)

- **Language**: Python 3.10+ with async/await patterns
- **REST Framework**: FastAPI (async, modern)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (async driver: asyncpg for PostgreSQL)
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic v2 (schemas, DTOs, settings)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (two isolated databases: catalog_db, loan_db)
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (async, event-driven, Topic exchange pattern)
- **Testing**: pytest with async support (`pytest-asyncio`)
- **BDD / Acceptance Tests**: `pytest-bdd` — feature files in `features/`, step implementations in `tests/acceptance/steps/`
- **Acceptance Fixtures**: Testcontainers (`testcontainers[postgres,rabbitmq]`) — use real PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ; do NOT use in-memory SQLite for acceptance tests. Requires a running container engine; probe with `docker info` and skip the suite (reporting the gap) when there is none
- **Quality Tools**: `cosmic-ray` (mutation testing), `mypy` (strict type checking), `ruff` (linting + formatting), `radon` (complexity/CRAP), `hypothesis` (property-based testing)
- **Package Manager**: `uv`

All services use the same tech stack. No divergence.

---

## Quality Gates

Coverage, type checking, and lint are checked before every handoff, including the coder's.
Mutation testing is the architect's responsibility (full run, once per cycle) — the coder never
runs it, and the refactorer only scans mutation site counts (see `constitution/roles/coder.md`
and `refactorer.md` → Non-Ownership). Do not send a handoff if a gate you own fails.

- **Mutation Testing**: `domain/` and `application/` must achieve mutation score ≥ 80% — one `cosmic-ray` session per service, gated with `cr-rate --fail-over 20 <session>.sqlite`
- **Test Coverage**: All code must achieve > 90% — `coverage run -m pytest && coverage report`
- **Type Checking**: All code must pass `mypy` in strict mode, no `type: ignore` without explanation — `mypy catalog/ loans/ --strict`
- **Code Style**: Must pass `ruff` and `black` — `ruff check . && black --check .`

---

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): pure business logic in isolation, mock all dependencies, no I/O, run fast. Coverage > 90%, mutation score ≥ 80%.

**Acceptance Tests** (`tests/acceptance/`): pytest-bdd step implementations that execute the `.feature` files in `features/`. Each step file must call `scenarios("features/<file>.feature")` so pytest treats the Gherkin scenarios as live test cases — without this the `.feature` files are dead documentation. Use Testcontainers for real PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ — do not use in-memory SQLite here.

**Property Tests** (`tests/property/`): Hypothesis-based randomized tests for domain invariants and edge cases. Organized per service and layer (mirroring `tests/unit/`), covering domain entities, value objects, validation rules, and application-layer transformations. Property tests exercise a broad input space and verify that business rules hold under any valid state.

**Test Organization**:

```text
tests/
├── conftest.py
├── unit/
│   ├── catalog/
│   │   ├── domain/         (unit tests for catalog domain)
│   │   └── application/    (unit tests for catalog application services)
│   └── loans/
│       ├── domain/
│       └── application/
└── acceptance/
    ├── conftest.py          (Testcontainers session fixtures)
    └── steps/
        ├── catalog_steps.py (step defs for features/cat-*.feature)
        └── loan_steps.py    (step defs for features/loan-*.feature)
features/                    (Gherkin specs — owned by specifier, do not modify)
```

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `pytest` | All tests — run before handoff |
| `pytest tests/unit/` | Unit tests only — quick feedback |
| `pytest tests/acceptance/` | Acceptance tests (requires running containers) |
| `pytest --cov=catalog --cov=loan` | Coverage report |
| `cosmic-ray init mutation-catalog.toml mutation-catalog.sqlite` then `cosmic-ray exec mutation-catalog.toml mutation-catalog.sqlite` | Mutation testing (repeat for `loans`) |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Code language**: English only — comments, docstrings, variable names, error messages. Test data may contain Unicode.
- **Error handling**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes (404 not found, 409 conflict, 422 validation, 500 server error).
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging in the infrastructure layer using standard library `logging`.
- **Authentication**: Not required for MVP.
